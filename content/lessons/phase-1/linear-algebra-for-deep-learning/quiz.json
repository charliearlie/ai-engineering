      "correctAnswer": "7",
      "options": ["7", "9", "5", "11"],
      "explanation": "Dot product = (2×4) + (3×-1) + (1×2) = 8 - 3 + 2 = 7. This is the fundamental operation neurons use to calculate their output.",

      "questionText": "What does a matrix represent in a neural network?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "The weights connecting one layer to the next",

        "The input data",

        "The final output",
        "The learning rate"
      ],
      "explanation": "Matrices store all the weights between neural network layers. Each row represents one neuron's weights, and each column represents connections from one input.",

    {
      "questionText": "If you have 5 inputs and 3 neurons in the next layer, what shape should the weight matrix be?",

        "5×5 (5 rows, 5 columns)",
        "3×3 (3 rows, 3 columns)"
      ],
      "explanation": "The weight matrix needs 3 rows (one per neuron) and 5 columns (one per input). This gives each of the 3 neurons a weight for each of the 5 inputs.",

    {
      "questionText": "What is the main advantage of using matrix operations in neural networks?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "We can calculate all neurons in a layer simultaneously",
      "options": [
        "It uses less memory",
        "We can calculate all neurons in a layer simultaneously",
        "It's easier to understand",
        "It prevents errors"
      ],
      "explanation": "Matrix operations allow us to process entire layers at once instead of calculating each neuron separately. This makes neural networks thousands of times faster, especially on GPUs.",

      "correctAnswer": "[-1, 2]",
      "options": ["[1, 2]", "[-1, 2]", "[3, 4]", "[0, 4]"],
      "explanation": "First neuron: (0.5×2) + (-0.5×4) = 1 - 2 = -1. Second neuron: (1.0×2) + (0.0×4) = 2 + 0 = 2. Result: [-1, 2]",

        "Adds 1 to all values",
        "Calculates the inverse"
      ],
      "explanation": "The transpose operation flips a matrix over its diagonal, turning rows into columns and columns into rows. A 2×3 matrix becomes 3×2 after transposing.",

        "3×10 (3 neurons, 10 outputs each)",
        "5×3 (5 inputs, 3 neurons)"
      ],
      "explanation": "Batch processing maintains the batch dimension. With 10 samples going through a layer that outputs 3 values, you get a 10×3 output matrix.",

    {
      "questionText": "Why must matrix dimensions match in neural networks?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",

        "To save memory",
        "To make calculations faster",
        "The number of outputs from one layer must match the number of inputs to the next",
        "To prevent overfitting"
      ],
      "explanation": "Matrix multiplication requires compatible dimensions. The outputs from one layer become the inputs to the next, so dimensions must align properly for the operations to work.",
