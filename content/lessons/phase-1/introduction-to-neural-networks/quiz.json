      "questionText": "What is the main way that neural networks learn?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "By adjusting weights based on examples",
      "options": [
        "By following pre-programmed rules",
        "By adjusting weights based on examples",
        "By memorizing all training data",
        "By random guessing"
      ],
      "explanation": "Neural networks learn by adjusting their weights based on examples. They look at the difference between their predictions and correct answers, then update weights to reduce errors.",

      "questionText": "In a simple neuron with inputs for temperature (weight=0.5), rain (weight=-2.0), umbrella (weight=1.0), and bias=-10, what would it calculate for a 70°F day with rain and an umbrella?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "26",
      "options": ["26", "36", "-26", "16"],
      "explanation": "Calculation: (70 × 0.5) + (1 × -2.0) + (1 × 1.0) + (-10) = 35 - 2 + 1 - 10 = 24. Since this is positive, the neuron would output 'Go outside!'",

      "questionText": "What is the correct order of steps in neural network learning?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "Make prediction → Calculate error → Update weights → Repeat",

        "Make prediction → Update weights → Calculate error → Repeat"
      ],
      "explanation": "The learning process follows this cycle: 1) Make a prediction using current weights, 2) Calculate the error between prediction and correct answer, 3) Update weights to reduce error, 4) Repeat with more examples.",

      "questionText": "If you're building a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9), how many neurons would you need in the output layer?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "10",
      "options": ["1", "9", "10", "100"],
      "explanation": "You need 10 neurons in the output layer - one for each possible digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Each neuron represents the network's confidence that the input is that particular digit.",

      "questionText": "What does a 'weight' represent in a neural network?",

        "How important or influential an input is",

        "The number of neurons in a layer",
        "The final prediction of the network"

      "explanation": "Weights determine how much influence each input has on the neuron's output. Positive weights mean the input encourages activation, while negative weights discourage it.",

      "questionText": "In our learning example, if a network learns to multiply by 2 (weight converges to 2.0), what weight would you expect if it learned to multiply by 5?",

      "correctAnswer": "5.0",
      "options": ["2.5", "5.0", "10.0", "0.5"],
      "explanation": "The weight directly represents the multiplication factor. To multiply inputs by 5, the weight should converge to 5.0 through the learning process.",

      "questionText": "Why are neural networks particularly good at tasks like image recognition?",

        "They can automatically discover complex patterns in data",
        "They memorize every image exactly",
        "They follow strict programmed rules for images",
        "They work faster than traditional programs"

      "explanation": "Neural networks excel at pattern recognition because they can automatically learn hierarchical features - from simple edges to complex objects - without being explicitly programmed with rules.",

      "questionText": "What happens during the 'forward pass' in a neural network?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "Input flows through the network to produce a prediction",
      "options": [
        "Weights are updated based on errors",
        "Input flows through the network to produce a prediction",
        "The network learns new patterns",
        "Errors are calculated and sent backwards"
      ],
      "explanation": "During the forward pass, input data flows through the network layer by layer, with each layer applying weights and activation functions, until it produces a final prediction at the output.",
      "orderIndex": 8
    },
    {
      "questionText": "If your neural network makes the same prediction for every input, what is the most likely problem?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "The weights haven't been properly initialized or trained",
      "options": [
        "The network is too smart",
        "The inputs are all identical",
        "The weights haven't been properly initialized or trained",
        "The network has too many neurons"
      ],
      "explanation": "If a network always outputs the same prediction, it usually means the weights are stuck (perhaps all zeros or not updating properly during training), preventing the network from learning different patterns.",

    {
      "questionText": "What role does the 'bias' play in a neuron?",
      "questionType": "multiple_choice",
      "correctAnswer": "It shifts the activation threshold up or down",
      "options": [
        "It makes the network biased toward certain answers",
        "It speeds up computation",
        "It shifts the activation threshold up or down",
        "It connects neurons to each other"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bias is like a baseline or offset that shifts when a neuron activates. A negative bias means the neuron needs stronger positive inputs to activate, while positive bias makes it easier to activate.",
