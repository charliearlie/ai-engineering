## Narrative

Sarah, a data analyst wanting to transition into AI engineering, discovers the platform through a colleague's recommendation. She starts with the first lesson on neural networks, reading through the clear explanations while examining the accompanying code. She modifies the example code in the built-in editor, running it to see how parameter changes affect the output. After grasping the concepts, she takes the quiz, receiving instant feedback that reinforces her understanding. The platform saves her progress, allowing her to continue learning during her commute the next day on her phone, picking up exactly where she left off.
